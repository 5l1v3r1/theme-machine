### Bootstrap 4 Theme Machine

## A collection of stylized Bootstrap 4 Themes by HackerThemes

This project includes all the Free and Open Source Bootstrap 4 themes on HackerThemes.com. Each folder under `/dist/` is it's own theme, which includes a small starter template for the default template as well.

## Build steps

To build and modify the themes, you'll need to use npm and gulp. On Ubuntu (and hopefully other systems :-) you can do:

1. `npm install` to install all the dependencies
2. `npm install gulp -g` to install gulp globally
3. `gulp` to run the build once or `gulp watch` to turn on the watcher that rebuilds as you edit
